# Automation
## or
# I'm too lazy to do it manually!

So you started streaming, and it's working okay, but so much has to be done by
hand? You need automation. You need a machine to do your work so you can focus
on the content of your streams. Here are a few tools that can help a lot!

Some of these tools are things I've created. Others are tools that I can
personally recommend. All of them will cost you nothing at all.

## Going live: Mustard Mine

Before you hit that all-important "Start Streaming" button, you'll want to set
your game/category, title, tags, and so on.

[The Mustard Mine](https://mustard-mine.herokuapp.com/) can take care of this,
and can also schedule a tweet, manage a countdown timer, and related tasks.

This is extremely helpful when you operate a rotating schedule (eg "on Monday,
I play games, but on Wednesday I create art"), as it's far easier to let
someone else remember which tags you were using than to pick them out again!

(TODO: Does SLOBS have anything that parallels this?)

## Emote testing: Contrast Tool

Mainly this is of interest to emote artists, but possibly for others too. You
can test out emotes to see how they line up, how good they look on the main
background colours they'll be seen on, etc. [https://twitch-contrast.firebaseapp.com/](https://twitch-contrast.firebaseapp.com/)
