# Automation

# I'm too lazy to do it manually!

So you started streaming, and it's working okay, but so much has to be done by
hand? You need automation. You need a machine to do your work so you can focus
on the content of your streams. Here are a few tools that can help a lot!

## Going live

Before you hit that all-important "Start Streaming" button, you'll want to set
your game/category, title, tags, and so on. There are various tools that can
help you do this.

* Mustard Mine - retain "setups" with everything you need (mainly title/tags/category)
  and switch between them easily
* StreamLabs OBS? TODO: Confirm
* TODO: Get more

## Emote testing

Mainly this is of interest to emote artists, but possibly for others too. You
can test out emotes to see how they line up, how good they look on the main
background colours they'll be seen on, etc. [https://twitch-contrast.firebaseapp.com/](https://twitch-contrast.firebaseapp.com/)
