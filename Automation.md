# Automation

# I'm too lazy to do it manually!

So you started streaming, and it's working okay, but so much has to be done by
hand? You need automation. You need a machine to do your work so you can focus
on the content of your streams. Here are a few tools that can help a lot!

## Channel bots

Nearly every channel has a resident bot. The most common job that bots do is to
respond with preprogrammed information when people type commands, such as `!twitter`
giving a response such as "Check out my Twitter at https://twitter.com/MY_USER_NAME".
Once you've set up the bot command, it'll remember it and save you the trouble of
saying or typing it every time.

There are many bots available to use on Twitch. Some of them you install and run,
others are available under their own names; some are free, others cost money; some
have many features and others are more minimal. Check a few out, and don't be
afraid to use more than one bot - they don't fight (usually)!

### Installable bots

These bots can be downloaded and run on your own computer, and they'll use the
name of whatever account you authenticate them with. You'll see various channels
give their bots appropriate names, such as CutieCakeBot (DeviCat), LuneyBot
(Ellalune), mirrors_reflection (Person_in_the_MIRROR), etc.

* StreamLabs Chatbot (formerly Ankhbot)
* DeepBot (non-free)
* StilleBot
* Many many others

### Activatable bots

These bots already exist, and you can ask them to serve in your channel.

* StreamElements
* Nightbot
* WizeBot
* Rosuav's StilleBot (yes, the same software you can install)
* And many others

## Going live

Before you hit that all-important "Start Streaming" button, you'll want to set
your game/category, title, tags, and so on. There are various tools that can
help you do this.

* Mustard Mine - retain "setups" with everything you need (mainly title/tags/category)
  and switch between them easily
* StreamLabs OBS? TODO: Confirm
* TODO: Get more

## Emote testing

Mainly this is of interest to emote artists, but possibly for others too. You
can test out emotes to see how they line up, how good they look on the main
background colours they'll be seen on, etc. [https://twitch-contrast.firebaseapp.com/](https://twitch-contrast.firebaseapp.com/)
