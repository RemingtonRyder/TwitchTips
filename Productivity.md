# Flexibility, control, and productivity

Want more out of your Twitch stream? Want to do the same things but differently?
These tools are for you! Just three easy payments of $19.99... actually they're
all free, even better!

## Pixel Plush games

Created by [MaayaInsane](https://twitch.tv/maayainsane) and
[InstaFluff](https://twitch.tv/instafluff), these games are all freely available
to streamers and viewers. Incorporate them in your stream via browser sources
and interact with them in chat; they can be used for your "Be Right Back" scene
or overlaid on your main scenes to keep your viewers entertained and engaged.

Go to [https://www.pixelplush.dev/](https://www.pixelplush.dev/) to get started.
There are a number of games available, including a maze (in various themes), a
parachute drop, and Plinko.

Premium (cosmetic) features are available to viewers but are entirely optional.

## Mod lookup

Considering someone for a mod sword but unsure how much experience they have?
Quickly and easily see which channels they carry swords in. Far easier than
guessing channel names, going to them all, and typing "/mods"!

Available at [https://modlookup.3v.fi/](https://modlookup.3v.fi/).

## Rabbit's Watch

For the streamer who wants a place to jot down notes about people, like how
he asked for his name to be pronounced, or what time zone she said she was in.
When a viewer enters the stream and says hello, all your notes will be pulled
up immediately, including a ticking clock in that person's time zone, if s/he
has set one.

Streamers, go here: [https://rabbits-watch.herokuapp.com/](https://rabbits-watch.herokuapp.com/)
and authenticate with Twitch.

Viewers, go here [https://rabbits-watch.herokuapp.com/tz](https://rabbits-watch.herokuapp.com/tz)
to see your timezone in the way that the Watch recognizes it. You can let the
streamer know your timezone and it'll be remembered. Note that this is safe
against Daylight Saving Time switches, so if you say you're in New York, it can
correctly figure out whether you're on Daylight or Standard time.

## OBS Remote Control

For a bit of extra flexibility, you can manage your stream from a phone, tablet,
laptop, or other nearby computer.

Start by [installing an OBS plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-websocket-remote-control-obs-studio-from-websockets.466/)
and optionally configuring a password. Then you can use any of a number of
remote control tools, including (but not limited to!) these.

### OBS Tablet Remote Control

Quickly switch scenes, start/stop the broadcast, start/stop recording, hide or
mute individual scene elements, etc, from a simple tablet-friendly interface.
(Works fine on a desktop or phone too.) If you were yearning for a StreamDeck
just to switch scenes, consider using this as a zero-dollar alternative!

### OBS Remote Volume

Adjust audio balance by tweaking the different volume levels, make small
tweaks to your stream layout, or check the actual numbers of pixels in places.

## On-Screen Display of Rewards

Use Twitch's channel points for any sort of queueing system. People can use a
custom reward (create one [on your Twitch dashboard](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/community/channel-points))
to add themselves to the queue, and the streamer or a mod can advance the queue
when it's someone's turn. Good for Just Dance streams, team games, or anything
else where you want to govern access with channel points.

Start [here](https://rosuav.github.io/OSDRewards/) and it'll walk you through
the setup.
