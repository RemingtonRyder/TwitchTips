# The Absolute Minimum You Need To Know

So, you want to start streaming? Cool! It can be intimidating, but that's why
I'm here (to intimidate you - no wait, that's not what I meant!).

## Software

You'll need some sort of streaming software. For streaming from certain game
consoles, from an iPad, or some other platforms, there may be a native app for
this purpose; for most people, I recommend [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/),
or its relative [SLOBS](https://streamlabs.com/streamlabs-obs).

Whatever you pick, there's probably an automatic setup option that will do most
of the work for you. Let it pick a bandwidth and resolution for you if possible.

## Webcam

A webcam is completely optional for many types of streams. If you don't have
one, don't worry too much about it; if you have a "bad" webcam, that's also fine.
The most iconic streaming webcams are the Logitech C920 and C922, which usually
cost about a hundred dollars; they'll serve you well for a face cam, or for any
sort of work camera (eg for traditional artists).

## Microphone

Got a basic headset? That'll work magnificently. Got a bog-standard laptop mike?
Even that will do for a start. You don't have to blow big bucks on a professional
microphone! Pretty much anything will do.

## A Twitch account

Log in at [https://twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) and pick your user name. It can
be changed later, but there are consequences to changing, so try to pick well if
you can.

Go to [https://www.twitch.tv/dashboard/settings](https://www.twitch.tv/dashboard/settings)
and access your "Stream Key". You'll need to give this to your streaming software.

Enable "Store past broadcasts".

You may need to enable two-factor authentication on your account too.

## Go live!

Have a very basic stream setup, and just hit that "Start Streaming" button!
The fun has begun, and it won't end any time soon :)
