# Channel bots

Nearly every channel has a resident bot. The most common job that bots do is to
respond with preprogrammed information when people type commands, such as `!twitter`
giving a response such as "Check out my Twitter at https://twitter.com/MY_USER_NAME".
Once you've set up the bot command, it'll remember it and save you the trouble of
saying or typing it every time.

There are many bots available to use on Twitch. Some of them you install and run,
others are available under their own names; some are free, others cost money; some
have many features and others are more minimal. Check a few out, and don't be
afraid to use more than one bot - they don't fight (usually)!

## Installable bots

These bots can be downloaded and run on your own computer, and they'll use the
name of whatever account you authenticate them with. You'll see various channels
give their bots appropriate names, such as CutieCakeBot (DeviCat), LuneyBot
(Ellalune), mirrors_reflection (Person_in_the_MIRROR), etc.
