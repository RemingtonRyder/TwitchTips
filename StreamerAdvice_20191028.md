Part III of the Streamer Tech Tips can be [found here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/500804957)
as a highlight from the Oct 28th discussion. The topics covered include:

* What sort of information is worth having in your panels? (00:00)
  - Social media
  - Rules optionally
  - Who you are
  - Emotes, maybe
  - How to support you (donations, Patreon, etc)
  - Crediting anyone or anything that requires it
  - Most importantly, schedule and other info that needs to be authoritative
  - Note that the earliest panels are the easiest found (on mobile), so
    front-load the important stuff.
* Google Calendar (9:41)
* Twitter and Discord (21:26)
* OBS (35:26)
  - Window crop + mouse cursor bug
  - Weird manipulations (rotations, colour filters, etc)
  - Studio Mode (55:33)
  - Stats window (1:47:32)
* Mustard Mine (1:06:03)

The highlight stops slightly abruptly because the conversation didn't - or more
specifically, after that point, the topic of conversation drifted into Linux,
Wine, and many things only barely related to streaming.
