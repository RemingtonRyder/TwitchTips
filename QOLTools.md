# Quality-of-Life tools

One of Twitch's best features is its extensive API and integration system,
allowing third party developers to work with the Twitch system to tweak things
and provide a variety of handy improvements. The tools listed here are mainly
of interest to broadcasters, but some may be of value to viewers too (especially
moderators).

## Better TTV

Also called "BTTV" or "Better Twitch.TV", this browser extension does a *lot*.
It permits free-to-use emotes (which can even be used by non-affiliates), has
various UI tweaks, an alternate emote picker, and more.

Download it from https://betterttv.com/ if you don't have it already!

NOTE: BTTV includes some paid features, including personal emotes. It can
still be used to great effect for free.

## FrankerFaceZ

Another browser extension, FFZ adds its own set of emotes, user interface
improvements, and integrations.

Grab it from [https://www.frankerfacez.com/](https://www.frankerfacez.com/).

NOTE: FFZ offers some benefits for donations but they are 100% optional.

## Lisp Whispers

Twitch Whispers can be a bit fiddly when you're in a full-screen game. They
show up with a highlight saying who whispered you, but you can't read the
actual message without clicking on it. Lisp Whispers will show you whispers
as they arrive, and can be slid off onto a secondary monitor for easy access.

Access it at https://rosuav.github.io/LispWhispers/ and optionally open it in
a popup window. It will need to be granted some permissions from Twitch.

## Greeting Mouse

Caught out by similar names and didn't notice that it was a new person in chat?
The Greeting Mouse will highlight the first message from each person.

[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/greeting-mouse/ncfbcmbgihgdlljhambifpmfgdpbdjom)
only at present (sorry, other browser users).
