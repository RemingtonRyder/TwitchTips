# Quality-of-Life tools

One of Twitch's best features is its extensive API and integration system,
allowing third party developers to work with the Twitch system to tweak things
and provide a variety of handy improvements. The tools listed here are mainly
of interest to broadcasters, but some may be of value to viewers too (especially
moderators).

## Better TTV

Also called "BTTV" or "Better Twitch.TV", this browser extension does a *lot*.
It permits free-to-use emotes (which can even be used by non-affiliates), has
various UI tweaks, an alternate emote picker, and more.

Download it from [https://betterttv.com/](https://betterttv.com/) if you
don't have it already!

NOTE: BTTV includes some paid features, including personal emotes. It can
still be used to great effect for free.

## FrankerFaceZ

Another browser extension, FFZ adds its own set of emotes, user interface
improvements, and integrations.

Grab it from [https://www.frankerfacez.com/](https://www.frankerfacez.com/).

NOTE: FFZ offers some benefits for donations but they are 100% optional.

## Lisp Whispers

Twitch Whispers can be a bit fiddly when you're in a full-screen game. They
show up with a highlight saying who whispered you, but you can't read the
actual message without clicking on it. Lisp Whispers will show you whispers
as they arrive, and can be slid off onto a secondary monitor for easy access.

Access it at [https://rosuav.github.io/LispWhispers/](https://rosuav.github.io/LispWhispers/)
and optionally [open it in a popup window](javascript:window.open('https://rosuav.github.io/LispWhispers/', 'whispers', 'width=600, height=400')).
It will need to be granted some permissions from Twitch.

## Greeting Mouse

Caught out by similar names and didn't notice that it was a new person in chat?
The Greeting Mouse will highlight the first message from each person.

[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/greeting-mouse/ncfbcmbgihgdlljhambifpmfgdpbdjom)
only at present (sorry, other browser users).

## Bell-Ringer

StreamLabs alerts are great, but the StreamLabs page itself tends to have a lot
of notifications, and it constantly seems to be telling you about *something*.
If that doesn't interest you, this extension will keep them out of your face.
You can still click on the bell to see what's new, but it won't shake around
with a red highlight any more.

[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bell-ringer/kffjmeljahpbomnnkjfjomemefgkdnlc)
only at present (sorry, other browser users).

## Tab muter

Muting the video player can have unintended consequences, but you should retain
full control of what you listen to. Chrome has some neat ways to mute and
unmute tabs but the user interface is a little limited, and requires the mouse.

With this installed, you can:
* Press Ctrl-M to mute or unmute the current tab, independently of others
* Press Ctrl-U to unmute the current tab and protect it from Ctrl-Shift-5
* Press Ctrl-Shift-5 to immediately mute ALL tabs, even if focus isn't on
  Chrome at the time
* Press Ctrl-Shift-6 to unmute tabs muted with Ctrl-Shift-5 but no others
* Manage muting and unmuting via an external integration if desired.

[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/websocket-tab-muter/fkchodnonbibmpdohfedhflalajgebkf)
to fix Chrome issues :)
